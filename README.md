## What it is

BFit Together allows friends to share their gym plans and goals and a positive and uplifting social media web app. Users can create an account, log their targeted exercises, goals, and mental state for the day, and see what gym plans their friends also have in store. 

See which of your friends is also on Leg Day and plan a trip to BFit together!

In-app messages, 'likes', and invites can be sent between users. 

BFit Together's mission is to make going to the gym a social activity and to inspire users to be their healthiest and most confident selves. While gym activity is shared, moods are kept private to allow the user to log their mental state honestly. Mental and physical growth come hand-in-hand. :)
